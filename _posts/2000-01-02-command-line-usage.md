Run the following command to convert a TZX to a WAV:

    tzx -o my_wav_file.wav /some/dir/a_tzx.tzx

A TAP file is also supported and can simply be passed like so:

    tzx -o my_wav_file.wav /some/dir/a_tzx.tap

If you have an alternate file extension, see the -t option.  For a complete list of options see the -help option.
